# A Test Sign-up Form

My first foray into creating sign-up forms for real!

[This is the design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/afdbabfab03fbc34783c6b6f3920aba4a4d3b935/intermediate_html_css/forms/project_sign_up_form/imgs/sign-up-form.png) I'm supposed to recreate.

Here's what I came up with: https://itsvictoroyedeji.github.io/test-sign-up-form/

The form's data doesn't go anywhere since it's a GET request with no link. So your data won't get hackity hacked.
